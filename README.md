# Iterated_PD

## About
This project is a simulation for strategy evolution/optimization using a genetic algorithm for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is the repeated version of the standard Prisoner's Dilemma, a famous 2-player symmetric game where each player has the option to "Defect" (D) and "Cooperate" (C). The game has the following payoff matrix

|                         | Player 2 Cooperates | Player 2 Defects |
|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Player 1 Cooperates |   **3, 3**          |  **-1, 5**       |
| Player 1 Defects    |   **5, -1**         |  **0, 0**        |
